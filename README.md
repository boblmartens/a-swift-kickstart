# Learning Swift
I am working through the book [*A Swift Kickstart* by Daniel Steinberg](https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/a-swift-kickstart/id891801923?mt=11 "A Swift Kickstart in the iBooks Store") and you should to.

Please consider purchasing his book and the others he has authored as well at [Editor's Cut](http://editorscut.com "Editor's Cut Homepage").

## Ultimate Goal
I want to become comfortable enough with Swift to be able to use it to create iOS and OS X apps.
